The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
